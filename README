GlitchSkills
------------

This is a little app to feed your Glitch addiction by allowing you
to babysit your skills on your Android phone. This is a very sad thing
to do, and you should go very far away from here and go mine Sparkly Rock
for your pennance.

To build this, you need ActionBarSherlock, as well as my own fork of the Android Glitch SDK.
