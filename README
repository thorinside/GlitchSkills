GlitchSkills
------------

This is a little app to feed your Glitch addiction by allowing you
to babysit your skills on your Android phone. This is a very sad thing
to do, and you should go very far away from here and go mine Sparkly Rock
for your pennance.

To build this, you need ActionBarSherlock, as well as my own fork of the Android Glitch SDK.

This application isn't in active development any longer. The skill tree maintenance was what killed it for me. Perhaps, I'll contact the developer of Glitch and see if they would be interested in providing an API for that.
